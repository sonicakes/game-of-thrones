### Time
no more than 8hrs

### User stories:

1. As a user, I would like to be able to sort the episode results by the date in both
ascending and descending order. By default, the episodes will display in ascending
order.
2. As a user, I would like to be able to filter the episodes by the season they were
released in. By default, all the episodes for all the seasons will be shown.
